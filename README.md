# Flutter Firebase Tutorial

In this lab you will learn:
* What a Firebase realtime database is

* How to set up a Firebase database to sync data with a basic Flutter app
* How to write security rules for your realtime database

Firebase is a cloud database that is run by google, has good security rules, and integrates nicely with flutter. The benefit of using a database is that information that is stored in variables on local devices can be lost, and cannot be shared with other users.  The firebase database allows you to store and update information in the cloud, retrieve information from the cloud, use the information with multiple devices, share the information with other users, and write security rules that determine who is allowed to access or write to the database.
